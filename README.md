### ColorFuel

ColorFuel is a simple one-page color palette inspiration site for designers, developers, or anyone who just needs quick color combos without overthinking it.

I built this with the help of [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), which generated most of the layout using React + Tailwind CSS.  
Full disclosure: Iâ€™m not a React developer â€” but I did go in and manually cleaned things up, added smooth scrolling, replaced a few components, tweaked some styles, and made sure the logo + header actually worked how I wanted.

### Live Site

### Features

- Curated color palettes with hex values
- Visual tags (just for show â€” no filter logic)
- Smooth scroll nav (Framer-style)
- Sticky header with working logo scroll
- Fully responsive layout
- Custom favicon + Netlify deployment

### Built With
- Bolt.new (AI code starter)
- React (generated)
- Tailwind CSS (generated + tweaked)
- Netlify (deployment)

### Why I Made It
Honestly, I just wanted to make something fast and useful that looked clean in a portfolio and actually worked.  
Even if Iâ€™m not a full-on frontend engineer, I *can* make edits, solve problems, and ship polished results.
